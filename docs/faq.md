## Frequently Asked Questions
### What is a Fixed Deposit (FD)?

{: .text-gamma }

A fixed deposit (FD), also known as a Term Deposit, is an investment instrument that banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFC) offer to their customers. Through an FD, people invest a certain sum of money for a fixed period at a predetermined rate of interest in an FD. The rate of interest varies between different financial institutions, although it is usually higher than the interest offered on savings accounts.

### How are we ranking one bank over other?

Our ranking is based on various factors, however at the minimum we are giving higher weights to established banks over NBFCs, and among established banks national or government banks more weights.
